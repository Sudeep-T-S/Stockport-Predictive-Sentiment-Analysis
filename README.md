# Stockport Predictive Sentiment Analysis

A machine learning project that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze sentiments from financial news and social media data (e.g., Twitter) to predict stock market trends. This project uses sentiment analysis to determine bullish or bearish sentiments and correlates them with stock price movements.

## Overview
The Stockport Predictive Sentiment Analysis project aims to predict stock market trends by analyzing sentiments expressed in financial news articles and social media posts. By applying NLP techniques, the project extracts sentiment scores (positive, negative, or neutral) and uses them as features in a predictive model to forecast stock price movements. This project is particularly useful for day traders and financial analysts looking to automate sentiment-driven trading strategies.

## Features
- Collects real-time financial news and Twitter data using APIs.
- Performs sentiment analysis on textual data to classify sentiments as bullish (positive) or bearish (negative).
- Uses a machine learning model to predict stock price movements based on sentiment scores.
- Visualizes sentiment trends and stock price correlations for better decision-making.
- Supports multiple stocks for analysis (e.g., MSFT, AAPL, TCS).

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python 3.x
- NLP Libraries: 
  - NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for text preprocessing
  - VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) for sentiment analysis
- Machine Learning Libraries:
  - scikit-learn for building predictive models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM)
  - TensorFlow (optional) for deep learning models like LSTM
- APIs:
  - Twitter API (or Tweepy) for collecting tweets
  - NewsAPI for fetching financial news articles
  - Alpaca API (optional) for stock trading integration
- Data Visualization:
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting sentiment trends and stock prices
- Other Tools:
  - Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
  - Git and GitHub for version control
